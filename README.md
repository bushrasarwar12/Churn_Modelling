# 🔁 Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network

This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave the service) or stay, using a trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The dataset includes features such as credit score, geography, age, balance, number of products, and more. A Streamlit web application is used for user-friendly predictions.
